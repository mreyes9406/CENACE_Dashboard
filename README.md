# CENACE_Dashboard
### Jiménez-Martínez Mariana C. & Reyes-Ortiz Marco Antonio

## Description
This project will offer users a friendly interface to interact with CENACE’s dataset containing information about energy prices in Baja California system (BC). BC is composed of 4 charging zones and 201 electricity nodes, each with its own local marginal price. 

Our dashboard will permit the user to select a specific period to analyze the data (between 2016-2019), and show three visualizations to explore the results:

* An interactive map, highlighting the maximum, minimum and average price in each of the four charging zones during the selected period,    in both the day-ahead and real-time markets. 

* A line chart showing the system’s running average price for the day-ahead and real-time markets.
  
* A stacked bar chart, highlighting the contribution of each price component-losses, energy, congestion- to the total daily average       price.

## Datasets
The entire data will be retrieved from CENACE’s API containing information about marginal energy prices in the three Mexican systems: BCS, Baja California Sur and the National Interconnected System. Th API documentation can be consulted in:
